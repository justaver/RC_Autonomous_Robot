# (INCOMPLETE BUILD WORK IN PROGRESS)
# RC/Autonomous Car
The RC/Autonomous Car is a versatile robotics project designed to function both as a remote-controlled vehicle and as an autonomous navigation system. Built using Raspberry Pi, this project aims to blend manual control via Bluetooth communication with intelligent navigation algorithms for dynamic environments.
# Progress
45% complete
# Features
Remote-Controlled Mode:
-Control the car manually using a Bluetooth-enabled device.
-Responsive movement controls for forward, backward, left, and right directions.
-Real-time feedback to ensure smooth and accurate driving.
Autonomous Mode:
-The car uses sensors to navigate obstacles and follow paths without manual input.
-Algorithms combine environmental data and pathfinding logic for seamless navigation.
Potential for future upgrades like:
-Object detection
-Line following.
-Dynamic rerouting.
# Language:
-Python
# Hardware:
-Raspberry Pi 3 b+
-4 DC Motors
-H-Bridge Motor Driver
-TF-Luna LiDar 0.2m-8m Single-Point Ranging module UART/12C 5V 6Pin 
# Why This Project?
This project combines elements of robotics, embedded systems, and algorithm design. It is an opportunity to:
-Learn and apply control systems in real-world hardware.
-Develop efficient communication protocols using Bluetooth.
-Explore AI and pathfinding for autonomous navigation.
Future Plans:
-Implement object detection using LIDAR or camera modules.
-Introduce GPS for outdoor navigation.
-Add a mobile app interface for enhanced remote control functionality.
-Optimize power usage for extended operation.
#Current Status
This project is in active development. Here's what's been implemented so far:
-Basic motor control via Raspberry Pi (Completer).
-Bluetooth communication for manual control (In progress).
-Initial framework for autonomous navigation algorithms (In progress).
# Underdevelopment 
-Integrate sensors for environmental awareness and obstacle detection (working on now).
-Refine navigation algorithms for smooth transitions between manual and autonomous modes (will be worked on). 
-Explore options for a dynamic UI to display real-time telemetry data (will be worked on).
