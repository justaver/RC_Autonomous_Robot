RC/Autonomous Car
The RC/Autonomous Car is a versatile robotics project designed to function both as a remote-controlled vehicle and as an autonomous navigation system. Built using Raspberry Pi, this project aims to blend manual control via Bluetooth communication with intelligent navigation algorithms for dynamic environments.

Features
Remote-Controlled Mode
Control the car manually using a Bluetooth-enabled device.
Responsive movement controls for forward, backward, left, and right directions.
Real-time feedback to ensure smooth and accurate driving.
Autonomous Mode
The car uses sensors to navigate obstacles and follow paths without manual input.
Algorithms combine environmental data and pathfinding logic for seamless navigation.
Potential for future upgrades like:
Object detection.
Line following.
Dynamic rerouting.
