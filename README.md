(INCOMPLETE BUILD WORK IN PROGRESS)
# RC/Autonomous Car
The RC/Autonomous Car is a versatile robotics project designed to function both as a remote-controlled vehicle and as an autonomous navigation system. Built using Raspberry Pi, this project aims to blend manual control via Bluetooth communication with intelligent navigation algorithms for dynamic environments.

# Features
Remote-Controlled Mode
Control the car manually using a Bluetooth-enabled device.
Responsive movement controls for forward, backward, left, and right directions.
Real-time feedback to ensure smooth and accurate driving.
Autonomous Mode
The car uses sensors to navigate obstacles and follow paths without manual input.
Algorithms combine environmental data and pathfinding logic for seamless navigation.
Potential for future upgrades like:
Object detection.
Line following.
Dynamic rerouting.
Hardware Components
Raspberry Pi: Central controller for processing commands and sensor data.
Motors: DC motors for powering the carâ€™s movement.
Sensors: (Planned or in-progress) Integration of LIDAR, ultrasonic, or IR sensors for obstacle detection and autonomous navigation.
Bluetooth Module: Enables remote control functionality.
#Current Status
This project is in active development. Here's what's been implemented so far:
Basic motor control via Raspberry Pi.
Bluetooth communication for manual control (In progress)
Initial framework for autonomous navigation algorithms (In progress)
# Next Steps
Integrate sensors for environmental awareness and obstacle detection.
Refine navigation algorithms for smooth transitions between manual and autonomous modes.
Explore options for a dynamic UI to display real-time telemetry data.

# Why This Project?
This project combines elements of robotics, embedded systems, and algorithm design. It is an opportunity to:

Learn and apply control systems in real-world hardware.
Develop efficient communication protocols using Bluetooth.
Explore AI and pathfinding for autonomous navigation.
Future Plans
Implement object detection using LIDAR or camera modules.
Introduce GPS for outdoor navigation.
Add a mobile app interface for enhanced remote control functionality.
Optimize power usage for extended operation.

#AutoCad
When the majority of the code is complete for this project, Autocad will be use to design the casing for the robot. The design as of right now is not complete.
